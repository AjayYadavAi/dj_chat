Notes:


the real-time chat application does not save your chat messages in the database before passing it to other client.



Why do we need Redis? When real-time chat does not need databases like mySQL, postgreSQL, it does not mean it never save the message. It uses message broker database like Redis to save the messages in a First-in-First-Out (“FIFO”) queue before sending them.
